//! Ploymorphism (One Interface ,Many Forms)
/**
 * ? Analogy: Think of a USB port.You can plug in a mouse, a keyboard,a flash drive or a phone.They all are different devices, but they all connect through the same standard interface(the usb port).The port doesn't care what the specific device is; it just knows how to interact with it.
 * 
 * *Polymorphism means 'many forms.' In OOP, it's the ability for different objects to respond to the same method call in their own unique way. It often goes hand-in-hand with inheritance.
